### Handle events fired by the server ###

###*
 * Called by the server once a player is accepted
 * @param  {String} id The client id returned from the server
 * @param  {Json} diceface The json to tell the client what faces are what numbers
###

###*
 * This is when the server is telling the client to update his version of the state
 * @param  {Json} s A json containing varaibles holding the state of the game.
 *                  Is of the format: {unallocated: [], required: [], 
 *                                     optional: [], forbidden: [], currentPlayer: Integer}
###

###*
 * Called by the server once sufficient players have joined the game, to start the game.
 * @param  {Player[]} players                 An array of player object
 * @param  {Number[]} resources             Array of dicefaces reperesenting the resources dicefaces
 * @param  {Number} firstTurnPlayerIndex      The index to this.players that specifies the goal setter

    #  the server sends the id of the first player, and its the same as our id, so we're first
    #  time to set the goal. We need to show the goal settings screen and let the player set the goal
    # show screen

###*
 * This is an event triggered by nowjs that says everything's ready to synchronise server/client

### Fire these events on server ###

###*
 * When client clicks send goal on the gui, call this function
 * @param  {Number[]}  goalArray An array of diceface symbols that specifies the goal
